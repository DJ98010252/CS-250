Interpreting user needs involves gathering detailed requirements through direct interaction with users, surveys, or feedback, and translating these requirements into specific, actionable features. Creating "user stories" helps in this process by breaking down requirements into simple, understandable descriptions of functionality from the user's perspective, usually in the format "As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a reason]." This approach ensures that development remains focused on delivering real value to users and aligns the team's efforts with user expectations.

Developing programs effectively involves adopting Agile processes like iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, promote regular communication, short development cycles (sprints), and frequent reassessment of project goals, ensuring that the product evolves in response to user feedback and changing requirements. Being a good team member in software development means collaborating openly, sharing knowledge, offering support, and being flexible to adapt to new challenges and feedback, all while maintaining a focus on the collective goals of the project.
